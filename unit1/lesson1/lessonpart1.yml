title: 🏆 Welcome, Challenger!
content: >
  *The stadium is alive with noise. Lights blaze down on a vast arena, banners
  of serpents snapping in the wind. The crowd stomps in rhythm, a thunder that
  rolls across the sand floor.*


  **Announcer**\

  Welcome, challengers! Tonight begins the Great Snake-Off — the legendary
  tournament where serpents clash to prove their skill, their cunning, their
  destiny!


  *The crowd erupts, chanting as the ground seems to hum beneath their voices.*


  **Announcer**\

  From every corner, rivals have gathered. Yet this year, a new contender rises…
  SnakeBot! But even the strongest serpent cannot win alone. SnakeBot has chosen
  a partner.


  *The announcer pauses, drawing out the moment. The torches around the arena
  flare higher.*


  **Announcer**\

  That partner… is you.


  *The audience gasps, then roars again. The announcer’s voice drops to a grave
  tone, as if speaking directly to you.*


  **Announcer**\

  You hold the key to strategy. Without your guidance, SnakeBot is nothing but
  scales and instinct. Together, you will rise — or fall.


  *The horns sound. The gates of the arena creak open, and the tournament
  begins.*
