title: ☠️ The Venomancer
content: >
  *The arena glows a sickly green as the gates creak open. A thin, sly snake
  slithers out, leaving trails of glowing mist. All around, strange food appears
  — some fresh and ripe, others dark and spoiled.*


  **The Venomancer**\

  Heheheh… hungry, are we? Too bad you can’t tell the feast from the poison. Eat
  up, little fool.


  *It scatters more tainted morsels across the floor, cackling gleefully.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  (disgusted) Ugh, you’ve got to be kidding me. I can’t tell what’s good or bad!
  If I grab the wrong bite, I’m done for!


  **The Venomancer**\

  (laughing wildly) You’ll never resist! The hungrier you get, the more tempting
  it becomes!


  *SnakeBot coils anxiously, glaring at the pit of food.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  This is where I need your smarts. You’ll need to tell me what to do and what
  *not* to do. This is next level prompt engineering!


  **The Venomancer**\

  (laughing even harder) I don't even** need a strategy! You'll lose on your
  own!


  *SnakeBot gulps and wipes off a bead of sweat.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Alright partner, you got this...right?
