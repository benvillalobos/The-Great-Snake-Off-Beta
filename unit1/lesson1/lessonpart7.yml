title: Serpent Supreme
content: >
  *The arena roars as Serpent Supreme uncoils from the gates, towering above all
  who came before. Its voice booms like thunder.*


  **Serpent Supreme**\

  Bow before me! I am Serpent Supreme! Every hundred ticks, my path will change!
  One moment I strike for food, the next I lunge for battle. None can match my
  chaos!


  *SnakeBot steadies itself, eyes narrowing.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Coach, he’s not bluffing. He’s going to keep shifting his style mid-match. If
  I’m locked into one approach, I won’t last a minute.


  *It coils tighter, voice low but firm.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  We need a strategy that bends with the storm — one that covers his shifts, no
  matter what he throws at us. That’s the only way we’ll keep up.


  **Serpent Supreme**\

  (laughing) Struggle all you like! The crown belongs to me alone!
