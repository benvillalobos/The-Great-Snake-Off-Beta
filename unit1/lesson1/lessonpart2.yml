title: Meet SnakeBot
content: >
  *The training grounds are quieter than the roaring arena. Stone pillars line
  the edges, and torches flicker in their brackets. From the shadows, a long,
  metallic-scaled serpent slithers forward, its eyes gleaming with confidence.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  So… you’re the one they paired me with. Don’t look too surprised. I may be a
  snake, but I’ve got more than scales — I’ve got style.


  *SnakeBot coils in a dramatic loop, flicking its tongue in mock seriousness.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Name’s SnakeBot. I can move, twist, and coil with the best of them. But…
  there’s one tiny problem. I don’t actually know what to *do*.


  *It hisses, shaking its head with exaggerated frustration.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  That’s where you come in, partner. You give the orders, I do the slithering.
  Buddy system. Cop-and-partner. Fang-and-whistle.


  *SnakeBot leans closer, lowering its voice as if sharing a secret.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  They call me “AI.” Sounds fancy, right? Truth is, I’m like a pet who can learn
  tricks — but don’t mistake me for some wise old serpent. I don’t really
  *understand*. I just follow patterns.


  *It flexes, puffing itself up with mock pride, then chuckles.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  So, coach, what do you say? You give the strategy, I’ll handle the scales.
  Together, we might just survive this circus of serpents.
