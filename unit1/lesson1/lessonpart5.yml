title: 🚜 The Bulldozer Snake
content: >
  *The ground trembles as the arena gates burst open. A massive snake with
  jagged scars and scales like stone drags its heavy body forward, each step
  sending dust into the air.*


  **Bulldozer Snake**\

  Slow… steady… unstoppable. I’ll crush you under my coils before I even think
  about food.


  *It slams its body into a pillar, splintering it in two, then hisses with a
  low rumble that echoes around the arena.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  (eyes wide, then narrowing) Coach, this one’s no snack-chaser. Look at him —
  he doesn’t care about food. He just wants to barrel through me until I’m out
  of the match.


  *SnakeBot coils tighter, clearly uneasy.*

  Here’s the lesson: not every opponent plays the same game. If I just follow
  “chase food,” I’ll get flattened before I ever take a bite. This is where you
  come in — refine the prompt. Think ahead. Plan for his behavior.


  *The Bulldozer Snake growls, dragging its body forward like an avalanche.*


  **Bulldozer Snake**\

  You can run, you can slither, but you can’t stop the wall.


  **SnakeBot**\

  (trying to sound confident) Coach, if you can keep me alive against this
  walking boulder, I’ll believe you’ve got what it takes. So what’s the plan?
