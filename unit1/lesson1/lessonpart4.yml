title: 🍗The Hungry Serpent
content: >
  *The arena gates grind open, and a long, lean snake slithers out. Its scales
  gleam like polished bronze, and its eyes lock greedily onto the food scattered
  across the floor.*


  **The Hungry Serpent**\

  Food! Glorious food! I’ll eat it all, every last bite! Nothing else matters!


  *It cackles as it lunges for the nearest morsel, chomping without hesitation.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  (rolling its eyes) Great. A one-trick snake.  He’s got one move — eat, eat,
  eat. To make matters worse, *he's faster than us!*


  *SnakeBot turns serious, lowering its voice.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Here’s where things get tricky. A simple prompt like “go for food” works fine…
  until it doesn’t. Hungry Serpent is faster than us and will always race me to
  the food. If we do the same thing, we’ll run into his tail eventually.


  *SnakeBot slams its tail against the ground for emphasis.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  That’s where **prompt engineering** comes in. You’ve gotta sharpen the
  strategy. Don’t just say “eat food.” Say it with more detail. Trial and error,
  until you find the strategy that can always beat this scale brain.


  *The Hungry Serpent lifts its head, crumbs of food still falling from its
  jaws.*


  **The Hungry Serpent**\

  You’ll never beat me! If it’s food on the field, it’s mine!


  **SnakeBot**\

  (smiling faintly) Partner, you ready to prove him wrong?
