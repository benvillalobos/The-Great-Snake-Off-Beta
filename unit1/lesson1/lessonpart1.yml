title: 🏆 Welcome, Challenger!
content: >
  *The stadium lights blaze. The crowd roars. Giant screens flash with the
  words: “WELCOME TO THE SNAKE DUEL TOURNAMENT!” You step onto the virtual arena
  floor, heart pounding. This isn’t just any game—it’s the ultimate AI
  showdown.*


  *Suddenly, a voice crackles through your headset:*\

  **SnakeBot**: “Hey, partner! You made it! I’m SssnakeBot—your coding sidekick.
  We're going to ssslither our way to victory in this tournament! You handle the
  ssstrategy; I’ll handle the code."


  *SnakeBot grins (well, as much as an AI snake can grin).*\

  **SnakeBot**: “Here’s the deal: We’re up against some of the toughest AI
  snakes in the world. Our mission? Build the best Snake strategies using the
  power of prompts. That means you tell me what you want, and I’ll turn it into
  code. Sound good? Great! Let’s win this thing.”
