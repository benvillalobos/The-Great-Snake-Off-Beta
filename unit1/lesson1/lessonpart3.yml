  **SnakeBot**\

  Alright, coach, since Iâ€™m an LLM, I canâ€™t just make moves on my own. I need
  your strategies, your prompts, so I can spin them into code. You give the
  plan, I give the code.


  *SnakeBot leans closer, lowering its voice like itâ€™s sharing a secret.*

  Butâ€¦ thereâ€™s something you should know. I donâ€™t always get things right.
  Sometimes I mess up without even realizing it. So, youâ€™ll need to keep an eye
  on me and double check my work.


  *SnakeBot flicks its tongue nervously, then brightens again.*

  Letâ€™s start simple. Try giving me the prompt: **Go after food.** Run the
  simulation a few times and see what I do. If youâ€™re curious, peek at the code
  too! Youâ€™ll see my coils turning into lines of strategy.
