title: The Hungry Serpent
content: >
  *The arena gates grind open, and a long, lean snake slithers out. Its scales
  gleam like polished bronze, and its eyes lock greedily onto the food scattered
  across the floor.*


  **Hungry Serpent**\

  Food! Glorious food! I’ll eat it all, every last bite! Nothing else matters!


  *It cackles as it lunges for the nearest morsel, chomping without hesitation.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  (rolling its eyes) Great. A one-trick snake. Coach, you hear this clown? He’s
  got one move — eat, eat, eat.


  *SnakeBot turns serious, lowering its voice.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Here’s where things get tricky. A simple prompt like “go for food” works fine…
  until it doesn’t. Hungry Serpent is faster, reckless, and will always race me
  to the snack. If we do the same thing, we’ll lose.


  *It slams its tail against the ground for emphasis.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  That’s where prompt engineering comes in. You’ve gotta sharpen the whistle.
  Don’t just say “eat food.” Say it smarter. More specific. Trial and error,
  until you find the words that make me act just right.


  *The Hungry Serpent lifts its head, crumbs of food still falling from its
  jaws.*


  **Hungry Serpent**\

  You’ll never beat me! If it’s food on the field, it’s mine!


  **SnakeBot**\

  (smiling faintly) Coach, you ready to prove him wrong?
