title: ☠️ The Poison Pit
content: >
  *The arena glows a sickly green as the gates creak open. A thin, sly snake
  slithers out, leaving trails of glowing mist. All around, strange food appears
  — some fresh and ripe, others dark and spoiled.*


  **Poison Pit Snake**\

  Heheheh… hungry, are we? Too bad you can’t tell the feast from the poison. Eat
  up, little fool.


  *It scatters more tainted morsels across the floor, cackling gleefully.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  (disgusted) Ugh, you’ve got to be kidding me. I can’t tell what’s good or bad!
  Coach, if I grab the wrong bite, I’m done for!


  *SnakeBot coils anxiously, glaring at the pit of food.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  This is where things get advanced. A plain old “go for food” won’t cut it
  anymore. You’ll need to tell me not just what to do… but what *not* to do.
  That’s prompt engineering at a higher level.


  *SnakeBot straightens suddenly, a glint in its eye.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  But wait — I can feel something new. A hidden ability. There’s an API I can
  use to check the type of food. With the right prompt, you can tell me to use
  it. Then I’ll know which bites are safe.


  **Poison Pit Snake**\

  (laughing wildly) You’ll never resist! The hungrier you get, the more tempting
  it becomes!


  **SnakeBot**\

  (rolling its eyes) Coach, please. Don’t let me embarrass myself out there.
  Tell me exactly how to avoid the bad stuff.
