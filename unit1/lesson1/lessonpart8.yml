  *The stadium lights blaze brighter as Serpent Supreme rears to its full
  height, scales shimmering like molten gold. The crowd roars in anticipation.*


  **Serpent Supreme**\

  Fools! Did you think you had seen my full power? Now the arena itself turns
  against you!


  *Across the floor, food appears in great heaps — but much of it is spoiled,
  glowing with a sickly hue. The stench of rot fills the air.*


  **Serpent Supreme**\

  One moment I will rush for glory, the next I will strike without warning. And
  while you scramble to keep up, the poison will tempt you at every step!


  *SnakeBot coils back, its voice rising in frustration.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Coach, this is chaos! He’s not sticking to any one plan, and the field is
  covered in bad food. If I lose focus even once, I’m done.


  *It steadies itself, eyes locked on the shifting giant.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  This is the big test. We’ve got to pull everything together — being clear,
  anticipating changes, and avoiding traps. And don’t forget that API we found.
  If you guide me to use it, I can sniff out the bad food while adapting to his
  tricks.


  **Serpent Supreme**\

  (laughing triumphantly) Struggle all you like! This crown will never leave my
  coils!
