  *SnakeBot slithers back and forth across the training floor, its coils
  twitching with restless energy.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Alright, coach, you know I’m AI. But here’s the important part: I’m an LLM — a
  Large Language Model.


  *It flicks its tongue, proud of the title.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  Think of me as a giant library of word patterns. I don’t read the books or
  understand the meaning — I just know which words usually come next. That’s my
  power. With that, I can generate strategies, or even code, faster than you can
  blink.


  *SnakeBot coils into a loop and stares at you.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  But there’s a catch. I can’t start on my own. I need something from you first.
  That something is called a prompt. A prompt is your instruction — your
  whistle, your playbook. You say it, I try it. No prompt, no plan.


  *SnakeBot straightens, voice rising in mock-heroic tone.*


  **SnakeBot**\

  So let’s train. Forget rival snakes for now. Just tell me: **“Go after
  food.”** That one prompt will get me moving. From there, we’ll get sharper,
  stronger, and smarter. Together.
