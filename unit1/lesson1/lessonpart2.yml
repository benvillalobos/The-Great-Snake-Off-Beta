title: 🤖 Meet SnakeBot

  *The training grounds are quieter than the roaring arena. Stone pillars line
  the edges, and torches flicker in their brackets. From the shadows, a long,
  digitally-scaled serpent slithers forward, eyes gleaming with confidence.*

  Here’s the simple version: imagine I’m a super-powered snake that’s read more
  books, websites, and stories than you could ever count. When you talk to me,
  you’re giving me a *prompt*—that’s just a fancy word for instructions or
  questions. I use everything I’ve “read” to figure out the best move.


  *It leans closer, lowering its voice like it’s sharing a secret.*

  Think of it this way: if you had a robot buddy who could cook anything, you’d
  still have to tell it what recipe to make. The clearer the recipe, the better
  the dish. That’s how I work too—you give me the strategy, and I turn it into
  action.


  *SnakeBot coils proudly, flicking its bandana tail like a salute.*

  Oh, and one more thing—I’m not just any AI. I’m a special kind called an LLM.
  Don’t worry, I’ll explain more soon. For now, just remember: you give the
  plan, I do the slithering. Together, we might just survive this circus of
  serpents.
